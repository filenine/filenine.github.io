Many apps on Linux let you open context menus with Shift+F10! These menus are often the same as right-click menus. For example, selecting a folder in Nautilus (the default file manager on GNOME) and pressing Shift+F10 opens the same context menu as right-clicking it would.

Similarly, you can open menus with F10! For example, pressing F10 in Nautilus opens the "Current Folder Menu".

Once you open a context menu, you can navigate it with the keyboard! I like it because I want to keep my hands on my keyboard instead of moving them to my mouse.
