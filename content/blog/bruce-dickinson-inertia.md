I didn't know he was writing solo songs that had '90s freshness! I've only listened to his heavier albums The Chemical Wedding and Accident of Birth. The chorus of this song explodes with a burst of cool air, and it fits Bruce's voice in a way '90s Iron Maiden didn't. I was listening to Fear of the Dark and No Prayer for the Dying earlier, and this is a refreshing change!

It also has a music video, with the band on a white screen, a guillotine, and a random spider. Bruce spends most of it singing as a head on a platter! I like the introduction, with an unusually handsome-looking Bruce walking through whiteness. He cut his hair! This was the first album of his where he cut his hair short.
