Linux lets you switch between different virtual consoles using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + F[num]!

Ctrl + Alt + F1 brings up a terminal with a login prompt. So do Ctrl + Alt + F3 through to F6.

Ctrl + Alt + F2 brings up your current desktop session.

Ctrl + Alt + F7 brings up your graphical login screen.

I learned about it when I accidentally pressed Ctrl + Alt + F1 and had no idea how to change it back! These days, I mostly use Ctrl + Alt + F7 to restore my login screen if my GNOME session hangs after I login.
